                        <h3>When to worry about your child's fever</h3>
                        
                        <p>Fevers are very common. They are part of how the body fights infection. The average child will get several viral infections a year — which means several fevers. The vast majority of fevers are nothing to worry about, and pass in a day or two.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, though, parents should worry. Here are some circumstances when you should be worried about a fever and seek medical attention immediately:</p>
                        <p>If your child is less than 3 months old. While most fevers in newborns turn out just fine, their defenses are still getting up and going and they aren’t very good at telling us what hurts.</p>

                        <p>The worldwide prevalence of obesity has dramatically increased, mostly in children and adolescents. The Emotional Eating theoretical model has proposed that the failure in emotional regulation could represent a risk factor for establishing maladaptive overeating behavior that represents an inadequate response to negative emotions and allows increasing body-weight. This systematic review investigates the relationship between overeating and both emotional regulation and emotional intelligence in childhood and adolescence, considering both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies</p>

                        <p>“If you live to be 100, I hope I live to be 100 minus 1 day, so I never have to live without you.” These beautiful quotes on Friendship Day are meaningful and one only realizes the true importance of friendship when they have managed to invest a great amount of time and deal in building everlasting relationships with their near and dar ones.

                        <h3>Physical activity is important for a child’s growing body</h3>
                        
                        <p>Children’s muscles, bones and emotional health can be improved with physical activity. Children’s muscles need to be used to grow and become stronger. Aerobic exercise helps the heart to become and stay strong. Children’s bones are not fully developed until the late teen years. Bone strength is built when bones are forced to bear weight and work against gravity; these activities also help to build muscles.</p>
